## Contribution

analyse is there to help and analyse a token to find out what would be the best lower bound
Strict minimum to work with

## TODO
- Have a DB with a correspondancy wallet address <==> to acutal (like binance, starkgate, etc etc)
- Could be extended to catch Bridging events too
- Could make a better way to store token list with check that all is valid
