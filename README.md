coincap io conversion token <=> $ value https://docs.coincap.io/

## Installation

## Contribution

analyse is there to help and analyse a token to find out what would be the best lower bound
Strict minimum to work with

## TODO

- Have a DB with a correspondancy wallet address <==> to actual (like binance, starkgate, 0x0, etc etc,)
- Serverless?
- Could make a better way to store token list with check that all is valid (selector shouldn't be a hash)
- add bunch of tests
- A way of automatically adjusting the threshold?
