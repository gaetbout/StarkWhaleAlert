Project
Make a tweet when transfer of at leasst X
uses alchemy RPC get_Events
starknetJS
coincap io conversion token <=> $ value https://docs.coincap.io/

## Installation

## Contribution

analyse is there to help and analyse a token to find out what would be the best lower bound
Strict minimum to work with

## TODO

- Have a DB with a correspondancy wallet address <==> to actual (like binance, starkgate, 0x0, etc etc,)
- Could store done tx hash somewhere to make sure I don't tweet 2x? Is it still relevant with replay block prevention?
- Could be extended to catch Bridging events too
- Could make a better way to store token list with check that all is valid (selector shouldn't be a hash)
- add bunch of tests
